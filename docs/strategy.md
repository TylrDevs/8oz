# Game Strategy
## Pre-Season Strategy Ideas
Our Pre-Season Strategies are highly subject to change as we have not competed at all.
 
* Scorer and Deliverer
 
We will have the Bot that is in the zone with our Goal be the Scorer. Their main purpose will be to put the Triballs on their side into the Net. The Bot on the other zone will be the Deliverer. Their main purpose will be to deliver Triballs to the other side.
 
* Barrier Jumping
 
Since the other team will be able to steal the Triballs from our Goal if both of our Bots are in the same Zone, if there is a situation where we both need to be in the same zone, one bot will cross the barrier in 
short bursts so that the other team does not have enough time to steal from our goal.
## Match Strategy
### Autonomous Period
During the autonomous period, our strategy will depend on which Role (Scorer or Deliverer) that our bot has.
 
* Scorer Autonomous Strategy 
 
When playing as the Scorer during the Autonomous Period, we will try to score our Pre-Loaded Alliance Triball, and then move on to attempting to score the rest of the Triballs in the zone. However, this could be problematic since the other team could program their bot to move around and disrupt our bot during Autonomous.
 
* Deliverer Autonomous Strategy
 
When playing as the Deliverer during the Autonomous Period, we will try to position ourself near the Match Load Zone, and, if it is legal, we will start to shoot our Match Loads to the Scorer Zone. Then, we will program our bot to drive around our opponent's goal, in hopes of disrupting their bot's programming. If shooting the Match Loads during Autonomous ends up being illegal, we will devote our Autonomous period to disrupting our opponent's scoring.
### Driver Control Period
During the Driver Control Period, our strategy will again vary depending on which role (Scorer or Deliverer) that our bot is playing.
 
* Scorer Driver Control Strategy
 
When playing as the Scorer during the Driver Control Period, our strategy will revolve around getting as many Triballs into our Goal as we can. We will first start by taking as many of the Triballs on the ground as possible, so that our opponent cannot deliver them over to their Scoring Zone. This will likely be a straightfoward plan for the first stage of Driver Control, since the opponent that is in our zone will likely be busy delivering their Match Loads to their Scoring Zone. After all of the ground Triballs have been used, (either scored or delivered to the other zone) we will switch our attention to disrupting our opponent if they are attempting to deliver Triballs. Also, if a situation where zone doubling becomes beneficial, we will attempt to do it while not allowing our opponents to steal Triballs from our Goal. If our opponents start zone doubling, we will either defend our territory or try to steal from our opponent's Goal, depending on which option will be more beneficial.
 
* Deliverer Driver Control Strategy
 
When playing as the Deliverer during the Driver Control Period, our strategy will revolve around delivering as many Triballs to the scoring zone as possible. We will preferably have delivered all of our match loads during autonomous, so our strategy for the first stage of Driver Control would be to focus on the ground Triballs and deliver as many as possible, while disrupting our opponent's attempts to score. Also, if we are able to design a mechanism that is able to block incoming Triballs, we will at times focus on stopping our oppoents from delivering triballs to their scoring zone.
 
* Overall Endgame Strategy
 
During the Endgame Period, the strategy will likely not differ much between the two roles. The strategy will also depend on the way our opponent's endgame mechanism coordinates with ours. Most likely, we will both just climb as high on the poles as possible. In the case that we or our alliance member have designed a mechanism that supports the other bot, we will attempt to use it to our alliance's advantage.
