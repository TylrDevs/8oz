# Game Strategy
## Pre-Season Strategy Ideas
Our Pre-Season Strategies are highly subject to change as we have not competed at all.
* Scorer and Deliverer
We will have the Bot that is in the zone with our Goal be the Scorer. Their main purpose will be to put the Triballs on their side into the Net. The Bot on the other zone will be the Deliverer. Their main purpose will be to deliver Triballs to the other side.
* Barrier Jumping
Since the other team will be able to steal the Triballs from our Goal if both of our Bots are in the same Zone, if there is a situation where we both need to be in the same zone, one bot will cross the barrier in short bursts so that the other team does not have enough time to steal from our goal.
