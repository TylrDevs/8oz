## Pre-Season Strategy Ideas
Our Pre-Season Strategies are highly subject to change as we have not competed at all.
* Scorer and Deliverer
We will have the Bot that is in the zone with our Goal be the Scorer. Their main purpose will be to put the Triballs on their side into the Net. The Bot on the other zone will be the Deliverer. Their main purpose will be to deliver Triballs to the other side.
